# Music Player build by React with Typescript

Example to build music player using React with Typescript. Support by [react-sound](https://github.com/leoasis/react-sound) library.

## Note
Some types used in the library are not included in the [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped). I have submitted the pull request for the type for [soundmanager2](https://github.com/scottschiller/SoundManager2). For the other one [react-sound](https://github.com/leoasis/react-sound), I have included to this project (in node_modules/@types/react-sound). Please note that you have to keep it after initalization of the project.

## Initialization
yarn:
```
yarn init
```

## Test
Start the localhost server using the following command:
```
webpack-server
```

Browse https://localhost:8080 to see the result.

Any modification use
```
webpack-watch
```
to watch the project and update directly. Note that it will trigger auto-reloading in the browser.

The project serves as practice how to build music player using React and Typescript. Any question in using the example feel free to ask.
